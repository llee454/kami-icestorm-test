IceStorm Test Readme
====================

This directory tests whether or not we can generate netlists that can be burnt onto an ICE40 FPGA board using the IceStorm toolchain.

To generate a netlist. Run ./build.sh.

See build.sh for the sequence of commands needed and for gotchas.

This package is intended to be copied within the RiscvSpecFormal directory, with the Kami directory at ../Kami, and the icestorm build tools in PATH.
